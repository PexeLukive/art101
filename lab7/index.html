            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The challenge of the lab was to learn to create JavaScript functions and implement them into the site I made.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I had a bit of trouble figuring out what I could do with the strings and arrays in order to get them to convert properly, and on my first attempt I'd accidentally returned the sorted array instead of the string that I put all of the array elements into.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
