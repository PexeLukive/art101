			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Task 1 - Pseudocode an everyday task</h2>
					<p>Creating a piece of digital art 
						1. Prepare canvas with desired dimensions (height/width)
						2. Sketch out ideas
						3. Color the sketch 
						4. Add lighting/shading layers on top of base color 
						5. Render the drawing by combining layers, filling in details, and cleaning up the sketch 
						6. Final touches (overlay layer, extra lighting effects, etc)
						7. Save and export
					</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Task 2 - Pseudocode a simple computer game</h2>
					<p>Creating a Tetris game 
						1. Create empty board
						2. Select one out of six block shapes to be put on board, slowly descending to bottom of board 
						3. Allow user to release block in desired position/rotation 
						4. Test filled-out-line condition
						5. Repeat from step 2 until board is filled to top 
						6. Display total score 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to become familiar with translating instructions into pseudocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>I had a bit of trouble trying to put the instructions of Tetris into a pseudocode format, but I solved it by thinking of what are the exact steps the game is played.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>This assignment wasn't difficult to understand at all, since I had done coding in the past that I'd also utilized pseudocode for to make those assignments easier to understand. But this time I didn't have time to link the images to the index.html of this lab because it's too late at night and I'm really tired.</p>
