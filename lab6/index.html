			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to learn to use arrays and objects in JavaScript to display information.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>I had a slight difficulty remembering how exactly to write the syntax for both arrays and objects in JS, but I solved it by going back to the lecture slides and taking note of the differences between them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>The reason I turned in this assignment late was because I didn't feel like I had enough time in the previous couple of days to work on it a satisfactory amount, and I thought it would be more difficult than it actually turned out to be. If I had actually checked the assignment beforehand to make sure it was well within my capabilities, I would've made more of an effort to turn it in on time.</p>
