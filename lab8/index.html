            <h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The challenge of this lab was to utilize callback functions and get more used to writing JS functions in general.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I spent a long time struggling to figure out how to check the console from VSCode before realizing that I was supposed to look at it from the uploaded lab page on the browser instead.</p>
